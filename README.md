# RaspberryBeats-FinalProjectCS121
Final Project for CS121
Using a Raspberry Pi 3B+, we created an interactive sound kit!

This was implemented in Python, and the program receives signals from a corresponding sensor on an Adafruit touch sensor soldered to the Pi, which plays and saves corresponding sounds. The user was able to choose a sound theme (animal, drum, random, piano, or music). Then based on the theme chosen, the program loaded the corresponding sound wav files onto the senors.

Using Flaskapp, JavaScript, & Initial State, the user is be able to start/stop, playback, and choose sound files for sensors to be loaded with, and then watch data received by Pi in real time
